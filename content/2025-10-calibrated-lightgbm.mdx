## TL;DR
We compare Platt scaling and isotonic regression for probability calibration under class imbalance and covariate drift, with a strict latency budget.

### Key idea
For a model score \( s \), calibrated probability \( \hat{p} = \sigma(as + b) \) or a monotone piecewise function via isotonic.  
We evaluate Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, and profit metrics.
